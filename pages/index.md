## Who I am?

Hello ðŸ‘‹,


<div class="w-40">

![me](/me.jpeg)

</div>

I am a SWE from Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Working @ [Evidence](https://evidence.dev) a startup


I joined [Evidence](https://evidence.dev) in 2023 and I was the 5th employee to join the company.

Before Evidence I was working at [SAP](https://sap.com) on the [Event Mesh](https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-sap/understanding-sap-btp-event-mesh-service-a-seamless-integration-solution/ba-p/13574122) solution. 


## Tech


I've used many technologies in my career. Those are my most used: `Go`, `Typescript`, `Firestore`, `Svelte`, `Git`, `Bash`, `NodeJS`, `Kubernetes`, `Postgres`, `GCP`, `Vscode`, `Cloudflare`, `AWS`


### History

I also used many other technologies in the last 10 years, see [tech journey article](./tech-journey)


### Computers

I also used many computers and operating systems, going from `Windows`/`Linux`/`MacOS` in many years. 

Going from `Windows` to `MacOS` to `Linux` and then again to `MacOS`. My [linux journey](./linux-journey) lasted for 4-5 years. The lack of time was the main driver to going back to `MacOS`.



## Projects

I started to really make software projects in 2015, after my first internship. I will make a blog post on all the attempts and projects soon.


### Learning with Projects

Tutorials and documentation are great to getting started, but at some point you need to start **making**.

### The Clinic

One of the biggest and ongoing projects, in recent years, my spouse and I launched a clinic called: [La Voix LactÃ©e, orthophonie](./voixlactee)
